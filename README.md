Overview Of The Project:
Project Title:
Password Strength Checker

Objective:
To develop a user-friendly tool that evaluates the strength of a user's password based on predefined criteria. The program provides feedback and recommendations to enhance password security, helping users create stronger passwords and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Problem Statement:
Weak passwords are a significant cybersecurity risk, often exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems and accounts. Many users are unaware of the factors that contribute to password strength, leading to poor password practices.

Proposed Solution:
The Password Strength Checker helps users assess their passwords in real-time by analyzing their composition and providing a "strength score" along with actionable recommendations for improvement. This encourages better password hygiene and enhances overall security.

Features:
Password Strength Evaluation:

The tool analyzes the password based on:
Lowercase letters
Uppercase letters
Numeric characters
Special characters
Whitespace characters
Each factor contributes to a cumulative strength score.
Strength Levels:

Passwords are categorized into five levels:
Very Bad: Needs immediate change.
Not Good: Needs improvement.
Weak: Requires stronger elements.
Hard: Decent but can be improved.
Strong: Very secure password.
Feedback Mechanism:

Users receive detailed feedback about their password's composition (e.g., how many lowercase/uppercase letters it contains).
Recommendations for improvement are provided based on the evaluation.
Interactive Design:

Users can repeatedly test different passwords.
The program allows them to check another password or exit based on their preference.
Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
getpass: To securely input passwords without displaying them on the screen.
string: For character type classifications (lowercase, uppercase, digits, etc.).
Target Users:
General computer users who want to ensure their passwords are strong.
Organizations promoting secure password policies among employees.
Students and beginners learning about password security.

How It Works:
Users are prompted to enter a password.
The program evaluates the password based on predefined criteria.
A detailed report is displayed, showing:
The counts of different character types in the password.
The strength level and feedback.
Users can choose to analyze another password or exit the program.
Benefits:
Improved Security: Educates users about creating strong passwords to protect against attacks.
Ease of Use: Simple, interactive interface requiring no technical expertise.
Customizable: The criteria and feedback mechanism can be tailored for specific use cases.
Potential Enhancements:
Integration with Databases:
Check if the password has been compromised using APIs like "Have I Been Pwned".
Graphical User Interface (GUI):
Develop a GUI for a more user-friendly experience.
Advanced Password Metrics:
Include entropy calculations for more detailed strength evaluation.
